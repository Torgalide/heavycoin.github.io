          <h2><b>Ultra-secure</b></h2>
          <p>
             Heavycoin introduces a novel ultra-secure hashing
             algorithm that employs multiple redundant cryptographic
             hash functions to secure its block chain.  Bitcoin and
             most other crypto-currencies rely on a single
             cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256.  Heavycoin
             aims to improve security by following the old adage of
             not putting all the eggs in the same basket.

          <h2>Democratic</h2>
          <p>
            Heavycoin is the first crypto-currency where the mining
            schedule and money supply are decided democratically by
            its user-base.  This is achieved by allowing miners to
            participate in a fully decentralized cheat-proof voting
            process.  The money supply still has a fixed upper-bound
            of 128M HVC.  Will there be 63M or 128M HVC?  How long
            until we get there?  You decide!

          <h2>ASIC-resistant</h2>
          <p>
            To support the largest, most vibrant mining community,
            Heavycoin introduces a novel ASIC-resistant cryptographic
            hash function called HEFTY1.  Initially this opened the
            door for thousands of CPU-only miners.  Currently HEFTY1
            offers GPU miners lean power consumption and low heat
            generation, which is great news for keeping electricity
            costs low and profits high.
